# Tic-Tac-Toe-Tech-Test

This challenge was set by Makers Academy as an example tech test.

## The Makers Brief

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

* There are two players in the game (X and O)
* Players take turns until the game is over
* A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
* A turn ends when a player claims a field
* A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
* A game is over if a player wins
* A game is over when all fields are taken

Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.

## How to run

#### Download the test
```
$ git clone git@github.com:LazySamir/tic-tac-toe-tech-test.git
$ cd tic-tac-toe-tech-test
```

### Use the application

### Test the application

### User stories

```
As a user
So I have something to do in my spare time
I want to be able to start a game of tic-tac-toe with a friend

As a user
So I can deploy my masterful strategy
I want to be able to place my symbol in a field

As a user
So I have some competition
I want my opponent to be able to place their symbol after me

As a user
So there is no cheating
I want game to declare a winner when all fields in row, column or diagonals are taken

As a user
So we are sure when a game is over
I want the game to declare a tie if all fields are taken but there is no winner
```

### Domain model

#### Approach

We set this task to complete whilst pairing. 

Our approach: 
1. Write out user stories
2. Draw a domain model
3. Hard code player and grid to be refactored/extracted later

#### Plan

1. Extract a grid class
2. Extract a player class


#### How I would improve the app
